## **About**

The ***Pomodoro*** technique is a time management method where you work on a task for 25 minutes (called a "Pomodoro") without distractions, followed by a 5-minute break. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This technique helps improve focus, productivity, and combat procrastination.

This project is a pomodoro timer, in a minimalist aspect. Runs well in desktop & mobile.
